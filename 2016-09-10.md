> The observant reader may feel at this point that structured procrastination requires a certain amount of self-deception, since one is in effect constantly perpetrating a pyramid scheme on oneself. Exactly. One needs to be able to recognize and commit oneself to tasks with inflated importance and unreal deadlines, while making oneself feel that they are important and urgent. This is not a problem, because virtually all procrastinators have excellent self-deceptive skills also. And what could be more noble than using one character flaw to offset the bad effects of another?

> Good listening includes interactions that build a person’s self-esteem.  Good listeners made the conversation a positive experience for the other party.  This doesn’t happen if the listener is passive or critical.  Good listeners help the other individual feel supported and convey confidence in them.  It is a safe environment where issues and differences can be discussed openly.  It’s not a contest to have a better idea.

Wow, $1,688.95 is a bit pricey!

I'm going to explore using the new Chromecast 2 ($30) for Casting to Hangouts and Cast for Education Cloud Services from Chrome.

Unfortunately BlueJeans and Fuze do not yet have native Cast-enabled apps, but

Google Cast is now fully integrated into Chrome (see also). And works with their (poorly named) Duo video chat app (gotta imagine that the pre-existing Duo Security is a trademark lawsuit waiting to happen?!)

And Google is thinking about use in the classroom (as part of 4 new tools they recently released).


ps. also checking out Chromecast Audio which now supports multi-room to group together speakers connected to individual Chromecast Audio devices so you can listen to the same song in multiple locations.

This is what we have in 1011. It is a small dongle that connects via USB and appears as a thumb drive to the computer. The user launches either the Mac .app or Windows .exe. After a few moments their laptop will display a notification that the device is ready after which a button push sends the display wirelessly. It also acts as an audio device so if it is part of a larger A/V system, the laptop can send its audio out to the room speakers.

Downsides are USB3C compatibility (guessing a simple USB-USB3C adapter will work) and lack of Linux and Chromebook support. According to this, one can use the Google Cast extension with it but I haven't tried it yet.

So far I've been really impressed.

# Jupyter-based Biological Data Analysis course

Subject: [py4science] Jupyter-based Biological Data Analysis course from Sean "hmmer" Eddy
To: py4science <py4science@lists.berkeley.edu>


Sean Eddy (original author of hmmer, co-author of "Biological Sequence Analysis", and all-around nifty computational biologist)
is teaching the first iteration of his biological data analysis course at Harvard, based on Python and Jupyter notebooks.
It looks like all of the course materials are going to be available on-line.  I think that this will be _very_ interesting to follow.
